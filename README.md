# handless_volume_control

Project to see if I could make a tool to control volume by using hand gestures. <br>

I finetuned yolov7 on images gathered with the data_gathering script and used the alsaaudio module to change the mixer settings <br>
thumbs up increases volume and thumbs down decreases the volume

Demo:<br>
